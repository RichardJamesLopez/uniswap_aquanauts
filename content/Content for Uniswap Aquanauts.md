## What is a Liquidity Pool? :question: 

#### What is liquidity?
Liquidity is how easily you can turn your cryptocurrency token into another token or cash. Generally speaking, people prefer more liquidity so they can use their tokens in many ways, and realize their value.

#### What is a pool of liquidity?
A pool of liquidity is a smart contract where you deposit your cryptocurrency token. People depoosit into these smart contracts because it helps the token be paired with other tokens, create more liquidity (which is generally favorable), and earns rewards for the depositors.  

#### What is a liquidity provider?
A liquidity provider (LP) is an individual who deposits their tokens into a liquidity pool. 

The idea is of depositing into a liquidity pool is similar to giving a loan, staking ones tokens, or locking up ones funds in a protocol. The main idea is that the LP is temporarily placing their tokens into a liquidity pool. After whichever period they want, they can then withdraw their original tokens and, in the process, will incur costs as well as accrue rewards. 



#### Why are liquidity pools important?

Liquidity pools are important because they make it easier for people to trade tokens freely. 

In a Traditional Finance(TradFi) model, there are market makers and large institutions  that help support trading but this model doesn't translate well to the blockchain for several reasons. In a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) model, people who deposit into liquidity pools can serve the same role and benefit directly with rewards.

Uniswap is a decentralized trading platform that has popularized liquidity pools for Decentralized Finance and Ethereum.

## What is in your Liquidity Pool? :woman-playing-water-polo: 

#### Where is your liquidity?
Your liquidity (tokens you've deposited) are in Uniswap smart contract until you decide to withdraw them. 

While they are in the smart contract, your value can generally be considered to be of 3 main types:

1. Liquidity
2. Rewards
3. Costs

#### 1 - What is your liquidity?
Your liquidity is the original amount of tokens you deposited into the liquidity pool. It is represented by an amount of LP tokens that you automatically hold in your wallet. 

When you withdraw your tokens from the liquidity pool, you liquidity is returned to you. This is done by a more complicated process of burning your LP tokens, which removes them from your wallet and reinstates your original liquidity plus your fees accrued.

Read here for what is [liquidity](#What-is-a-Liquidity-Pool?). 

#### 2 - What are your rewards?
Your rewards are the proceeds you get in return for providing liquidity. The return comes in form of the same tokens that have in the pool. They get added to your total balance of the deposited liquidity over time and are represented as a part of your LP tokens. 

To receive your rewards, you would have to remove liquidity (or exit the pool completely), and your updated balance will have the reward.  

There are also other types of rewards such as  "yield farming" programs that gives returns in the form of the Uniswap token, UNI. This is available for select types of liquidity pools and is usually on a limited basis as listed [here](https://app.uniswap.org/#/uni).    


#### 3 - What are your costs?
Your costs are the expenses associated with providing liquidity. They are usually: 
* gas costs to enter a liquidity pool (or add additional liquidity). 
* fees associated with signer transactions to approve a token 
* the gas costs to exit a pool (or remove part some of your liquidity)
* ***extra credit*** - there is a concept of Impermanent Loss which is considered by some as a cost

##### What are gas costs to enter a liquidity pool?

*Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.*

Read [here](#Gas-Fees) for what are gas costs.


##### What are the fees associated with signer transactions?

*Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.*

Read [here](#Signer-Transactions) for what are signer transactions.

##### What is the impermanent loss?
Impermanent loss is the difference between your token value if it were in your wallet and the token value while it is in a liquidity pool. 

It can be considered a cost in the event that a LP wanted to exit an liquidity pool at that moment. However, with time the impermanent loss can decrease to zero if the difference between values return to zero. This is why people consider the loss as non-realized while an LP is still in the pool.

## What does Uniswap do for you? :hammer_and_pick: 
Uniswap built the powerful Automated Market Maker (AMM) tool that has pioneered the Decentralized Finance ecosystem. The model has become so pervasive that several other popular decentralized products such as Curve, Balancer, and SushiSwap have built off of Uniswap's smart contracts.

### Product History
For a very high level overview of Liquidity Pools in Uniswap it is important to understand the most recent versions of Uniswap:

**V1** - This genesis version enabled LPs to add liquidity so long as they were paired with Ethereum. This limited the liquidity pools to be comprised of ETH/ERC20 tokens. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/JCZKs4Y.jpg)


Introduced in 2018.

**V2** - This second iteration enabled LPS to add all types of new liquidity. This expanded liquidity pools to be comprised of ERC20/ERC20 pairs. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/4GLkk1T.png)


There were also many new features such as a updated interface, price oracles, and flash swaps.


Introduced in 2020.

**V3** - This recently announced version enabled LPs to ***selectively deposit*** in Liquidity Pools. 

What does selectively deposit mean? It allows you to provide liquidity within specific price ranges. This means that while a liquidity pool was previously defined for the whole range of token prices, with V3 a liquidity pool can apply to a specific part of the price curve. This allows you more flexibility to set what kind of rewards to see based on how stable or volatile the price of the tokens may be.

There were also many new features such as an update to non-fungible LP tokens, advanced oracles, and new strategies for capital efficiency. 


Introduced in 2021 and slated to go live in May.

### Liquidity Pool Implications

When assessing your Liquidity Provider value and the liquidity pools you are in, you should  consider some of the following: 
* which version your pool is in?
    * as of March 2021, most LPs are in V2 pools, although some remain in V1 pools. Post May 2021, LPs should have the ability to participate in V3 pools. 
* were you an LP in a "yield farming" pool?
    * if so, you probably receieved a reward in the form of a UNI token as a result 
* how will your liquidity pool strategy differ going forward?
    * in V3 the introduction of range orders allows LPs to have more flexibility with providing liquidity

In order to understand how Uniswap works and why it differs from other exchanges, we need to understand a few fundamental topics.  Read on to learn about blockchain, the Ethereum network, smart contracts, and how they all relate to the Uniswap exchange.

#### Blockchain
In its simplest sense, a blockchain is an unchangeable record of tranactions with no central authority. This means that anyone can transact on the blockchain without fear that a central authority can intervene and stop them. Compare this to a bank where permission is needed to open an account, and the account can be closed at any time the bank decides to close it.

The most known blockchain is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a pure transaction network, allowing two entities to transfer value quickly without the need for a central authority.


#### Ethereum
Ethereum is also a blockchain. The main difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Ethereum allows for more complex transactions. This functionality allows for decentralized applications, which are applications with a decentralized blockchain as their backend instead of a centralized server. This lowers barriers to entry, and prevents downtime and unwanted data consumption from centralized entities.

#### Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are unchangeable pieces of logic on the Ethereum blockchain.  Any decentralized application (dApp) that you interact with is powered by a smart contract on a decentralized blockchain. Smart contracts are created by the development team of whichever dApp you are using.

#### How Does This Relate to Uniswap?
Uniswap is a [Decentralized Exchange](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-exchange-crypto-dex) (DEX).  This means that the exchange runs in a completely decentralized manner, with no central authority. All transactions and logic are built into smart contracts on the Ethereum network! Pretty cool, right?

#### Wallets
dApps require an Ethereum wallet to transact. An Ethereum wallet will support Ethereum and all tokens built on top of Ethereum. We recommend [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), it is the most used Ethereum wallet and is very simple to use.

#### Security
While blockchains are extremely secure, new users being victims of scams is unfortunately common. Never share passwords or private keys with ANYONE, no legitimate wallet or protocol will ever ask you for them.



#### Gas Fees
Be aware of [transaction fees](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp) on Ethereum. Because your transaction is taking up a small part of the networks computation power, there will be a fee associated.  Metamask will take care of calculating this fee for you.
